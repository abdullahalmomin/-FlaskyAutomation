Description about taken approach and potential gaps in application?

At first I first tried to install the application from github. 
I used Doker to install and run the app properly. 
After running the app from docker I tested the Login and Register functionality thoroughly. 
After that, I went to the API route and found no data. 
Then I read the instructions properly and try to get the data using postman. 
It took a little bit time to retrieve all the data form the API routes. 

Finally I started writing automation script using Robot framework and wrote some test case. 
For API testing I used python and requests library. 
I was not much aware about unit testing thatâ€™s why I had to study a little about 
Unit testing then I tried to write some Unit test case.
I know I could not implement automation scripts in a proper way because of time constrain.
In this project I could have used data driven approach, Implement page object model, 
add some negative test cases while testing APIs and may more. 
I know you I was given enough time but it my bad.
