Tell us what improvement would you propose for the app?

Iâ€™ve got some observations to share
I found no validation method was implemented in the input field while creating a user.
The Username, Password, First name, Last name, Phone number takes all types of data. 
For example in the password field some conditions could be added like
*	Password must me at least 8 characters long
*	Max length of password should not exceed 12 character
*	A lowercase letter
*	A capital (uppercase) letter
*	A number
*	A special character

Or In the phone number field it take all types of characters 
Phone number should be unique for each user. 
Normally Phone number should not accept any character other than + and number (0-9). 
And if the user tries to press other keys then he/she must see a warring message to write the above character. 
Finally the phone number should have a maximum length.
